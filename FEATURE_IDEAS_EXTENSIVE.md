# Blade Quest: Extensive Feature Ideas

A broad list of new features that would improve the game, organized by category. Use this as a backlog: pick by impact, theme, or effort.

---

## 1. Gameplay & Movement

| Feature | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Air dash** | One mid-air dash (or double dash for Ranger) with cooldown; resets on land. | More mobility and skill expression. |
| **Wall jump** | Jump off walls in the direction opposite to the wall (you have wall slide; add a jump that launches away). | Vertical and escape options. |
| **Crouch / slide** | Hold down while running to slide under low gaps; brief invincibility or knockdown on small enemies. | Level design variety and style. |
| **Ground pound** | Hold down in air to slam down; damage and stun small enemies, break props, trigger switches. | Satisfying “heavy” option. |
| **Backstep** | Tap back + a dedicated key for a short hop backward (no attack); optional i-frames. | Defensive option without full dodge. |
| **Climb ledges** | When jumping into a ledge, snap to climb-up (press up or jump to pull up). | Smoother platforming. |
| **Variable jump height** | Already have jump cut; tune so short tap = low arc, hold = full height for more control. | Finer platforming control. |
| **Sprint toggle** | Hold a key to run faster (e.g. 1.3x) with maybe more dust or different footstep. | Pace control. |
| **Stomp bounce** | Landing on certain enemies (or all) gives a small optional bounce to chain stomps. | Flow and skill. |

## 2. Combat Depth

|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Fourth attack / ability** | Per-hero unique ability (e.g. Knight block, Rogue backstab, Lyra magic bolt) on a long cooldown. | Hero identity and variety. |

| **Downward strike** | Attack while falling for a plunging hit (extra damage or stun). | Combos and style. |
| **Combo finisher** | After 3–5 hits, next hit has a different animation/sound and bonus damage or knockback. | Rewards aggression. |
| **Weak spot / stagger** | Enemies (or bosses) have a brief “stagger” state after X hits; window for big damage or execution. | Tactical depth. |
| **Block / parry expansion** | Paladin has shield; add a “perfect block” window that reflects projectiles or stuns. | Skill ceiling. |
| **Throw / knockback** | Heavy attacks launch enemies; they can hit other enemies or break props. | Environmental combat. |
| **Status effects** | Poison (DoT), slow, burn (from lava), freeze (ice realm); on player and/or enemies. | Realm identity and build variety. |
| **Execute / low-HP bonus** | When enemy (or boss) is below 10% HP, special sound/visual and maybe instant kill or bonus score. | Climactic feel. |

## 3. Progression & Save
